# TypeScript Fibonacci Sequence Generator Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in TypeScript functions:  failure to handle edge cases in input validation. The `printFibonacci` function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms, however, it does not properly handle cases where the input `n` is 0 or negative. This results in unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version with improved input validation.
